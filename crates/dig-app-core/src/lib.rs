//! # dig-app-core — the DIG user-app identity-agent core
//!
//! This crate is the **identity half** of the DIG engine/identity split (epic
//! [dig_ecosystem#908]). The DIG Node service is the *identity-agnostic engine* (P2P, content
//! serve, chain watch; it holds only a machine transport `peer_id`). **dig-app is the user's
//! interaction with that engine — and it IS the user identity.** This library holds everything
//! identity-specific and runs *as the interactive user*:
//!
//! - [`keystore`] — hold / unlock / **sign with** the DIG identity + wallet keys (dig-keystore
//!   DIGOP1 at-rest sealing; the user key never enters the engine).
//! - [`profiles`] — multi-DID profiles via `dig-identity`; create / select / edit the active one.
//! - [`wallet`] — the per-profile wallet host (spend building + signing stays local).
//! - [`storage`] — per-user AppData layout, DIGOP1-sealed at rest (NC-2 / NC-3).
//! - [`ipc`] — the per-user IPC endpoint address (named pipe / Unix socket) the session dials.
//! - [`session`] — the identity-authenticated engine session over that channel: the begin→attach
//!   handshake, the engine→app `sign` callback, detach, and re-attach.
//! - [`gateway`] — the CLI/RPC front door: authenticate callers, proxy engine work.
//! - [`identity`] — the two-identity model (transport peer-identity vs the user identity).
//! - [`form_factor`] — headless agent core vs optional GUI tray shell.
//!
//! The agent lifecycle that binds these together (U3) lives in:
//!
//! - [`agent`] — the per-user agent: start/stop, the reconcile run loop, and the live status.
//! - [`environment`] — the resolved per-user host facts every boot decision derives from.
//! - [`config`] — the agent's non-secret on-disk runtime settings (AppData, plaintext pre-U4).
//! - [`engine`] — the connection state + reachability probe to the identity-agnostic engine.
//! - [`shutdown`] — the cooperative shutdown latch that stops the run loop promptly.
//!
//! The normative contract for all of the above is the repo `SPEC.md`. U1 shipped the module skeleton
//! plus the pure helpers; U3 added the agent lifecycle and tray shell; U4 implemented [`keystore`]
//! (identity key generation / unlock / sign, DIGOP1 at-rest sealing, OS-credential-store primary +
//! sealed-file fallback, rotation); U5 implemented [`profiles`] (multi-DID create/select/list/edit
//! with per-profile sealed AppData), consuming U4's DEK sealing through the
//! [`profiles::ProfileSealer`] seam. U6 implemented [`session`] (the identity-authenticated engine
//! session: begin→attach handshake, the `sign` callback, detach, re-attach, multi-session). U7
//! implemented [`gateway`] (the CLI/RPC front door: route each command LOCAL vs engine-PROXY, over
//! the [`gateway::EngineProxy`] / [`gateway::LocalIdentity`] / [`gateway::LinkOpener`] seams).
